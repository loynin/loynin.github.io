<span style="font-family: 'Arial'; font-size: 16.000000pt; font-weight: 700;">Why Your Home Sell get EXPIRED?</span></div>
<span style="color: red; font-family: Arial; font-size: 20pt; font-weight: 700;"><br /></span>
<span style="color: red; font-family: Arial; font-size: 20pt; font-weight: 700;">“I’m Absolutely </span><span style="color: red; font-family: Arial; font-size: 20pt; font-weight: 700;">Shocked </span><span style="color: red; font-family: Arial; font-size: 20pt; font-weight: 700;">That Your Home Hasn’t
Sold! You’ll Be Shocked Too After You See The
</span><span style="color: red; font-family: Arial; font-size: 20pt; font-weight: 700;">TRUTH </span><span style="color: red; font-family: Arial; font-size: 20pt; font-weight: 700;">About Why It Hasn’t Sold.”</span><br />
<span style="color: red; font-family: Arial; font-size: 20pt; font-weight: 700;"><br /></span>

					<span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">Several months ago you were probably excited to sell your house. You just knew that it
</span><span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">would sell fast and you’d get absolute top dollar for it. Now, a half year later it hasn’t
sold and you’ve lost confidence in its abilit</span><span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">y to sell at all. Heck, as hot as the market is
</span><span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">right now, there were thousands of homes closed last month. But yours wasn’t one of
them. Well you’ll be happy to know that it’s not your fault!
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;"><br /></span>

					<span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">You see, many times a homeowner in your position wants to get their home sold but
</span><span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">once they’ve had a little bump in the road, they mistakenly think they need to look at
</span><span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">other options. They start wondering about staying in the home, refinancing or even
renting the home out. They lose sight of the fact that they actually wanted to SELL their
</span><span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">home and now they’ve lost their confidence in its ability to sell at all.
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;"><br /></span>

					<span style="font-family: 'Arial'; font-size: 12.000000pt; font-weight: 700;">Your Home Could Be SOLD For Full Price 29 Days From Today!
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Arial'; font-size: 12.000000pt; font-weight: 700;"><br /></span>

					<span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">In reality, your home may be one of the nicest houses on the market today. There’s a
</span><span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">significant </span><span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">chance that it’s not an issue with the market, but actually an issue with the
marketing. I’ve always found that any time there’s a house that hasn’t sold, it’s simply
because it wasn’t exposed to the most opportune buyers through a direct marketing
</span><span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">approach using marketing list selects and a target market campaign. This gets the
house placed directly in front of the most interested and qualified prospects rather than
simply listing it on the MLS and hoping that the random buyer comes along and
expresses interest.
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;"><br /></span>

					<span style="font-family: 'Arial'; font-size: 12.000000pt; font-weight: 700;">You Are Undoubtedly Frustrated
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Arial'; font-size: 12.000000pt; font-weight: 700;"><br /></span>

					<span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">Just so you know, you have a RIGHT to be mad. You have a right to be upset that as
</span><span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">nice as your home is, it still hasn’t sold. And the last thing you want to do is give up your
</span><span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">original game plan to try something that will end in disaster and loss of home value like
</span><span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">renting your house out or racking up tons of fees by refinancing your mortgage. It’s a lot
</span><span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">easier to just sell the home quickly and sell it for absolute top dollar.

Consider this an immediate warning</span><span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">.&nbsp;</span></div>

<span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;"><br /></span></div>
<span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">Don’t list your home with another agent (or&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: ArialMT; font-size: 12pt;">worse, the same one that has already failed). Don’t rent the house out to someone&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: ArialMT; font-size: 12pt;">that’s going to tear it up and kill the value. And you certainly don’t want to rack u</span><span style="font-family: ArialMT; font-size: 12pt;">p
thousands of dollars in fees and closing costs to refinance the house. Most importantly,
</span><span style="font-family: ArialMT; font-size: 12pt;">you don’t want to give up on your true goal of moving by staying in the house that you
don’t really want anymore. You shouldn’t make </span><span style="font-family: ArialMT; font-size: 12pt;">ANY decisions until we can address the
</span><span style="font-family: ArialMT; font-size: 12pt;">REAL reason that your home hasn’t sold and what could be done to get it sold in 29 days or less. If you decide to stay in your home, that’s fine. But you owe it to yourself to
</span><span style="font-family: ArialMT; font-size: 12pt;">at least find out how you can get the home sold 42 days from now at a price that is
acceptable to you.</span><br />

					<span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">Once you learn how you can successfully sell the house without all of the hassle while
still getting a sales price that works for you, THEN you can make a decision. But you
</span><span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">can’t simply make a bad choice about what you should </span><span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">do based on the fact that the
</span><span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">person you hired to sell your home didn’t get it sold. What if you could be closed and
gone less than 6 weeks from today’s date? It’s very possible and I can take a few
</span><span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">minutes to show you how.
</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Arial'; font-size: 12.000000pt; font-weight: 700;">Who Am I and How Can I Be So Confident?
</span></div>
<span style="font-family: 'Arial'; font-size: 12.000000pt; font-weight: 700;"><br /></span>

					<span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">My name is Steven Loy. I invest thousands of dollars to market properties to the
absolute most opportune clients within the marketplace. I use specific list selects and
marketing list brokers to FIND the best prospects and we market directly to them with
specific information about your home. You already know that a typical real estate agent
will just list the home on the MLS, run a couple of ads in magazines and maybe do
some open houses. Really? That is how they try to sell a home? They anticipate the
</span><span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">buyers will come to them? Real estate sales doesn’t work that way anymore. I spend
</span><span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">thousands of dollars to target market the best prospects rather than hoping that they
stumble across our public ads somewhere.
</span><br />

					<span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">I learned this approach from one of the most respected marketing professionals in
America and I am 100% confident that every project I accept will get to the closing table
</span><span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">quickly. Sure, I’m licensed by the state as everyone is required to be when handling
</span><span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">home sales but my major focus is on massive marketing and exposure DIRECTLY to
the people that will buy your home quickly.
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;"><br /></span>

					<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="font-family: 'Arial'; font-size: 12.000000pt; font-weight: 700;">I Won’t Commit To You Yet...
</span></div>
<span style="font-family: 'Arial'; font-size: 12.000000pt; font-weight: 700;"><br /></span>

					<span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">The reason I wrote you this letter is simple. I did some research on your property and
</span><span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">I’m interested. I absolutely will NOT commit to accepting the project yet but I’m
</span><span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">extremely intrigued at the possibility. I know you are too if it means you can go ahead
and get the property closed quickly and net the kind of price you want.
</span><br />

					<span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">We first need to meet. I want to take a quick tour of the property and find out about your
</span><span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">goals so that I can decide if this is something I’d want to take on for you. If it feels like a&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: ArialMT; font-size: 12pt;">good fit, you’ll be astounded at the number of highly qualified buyers that can write a full
price offer for you. I’m more than happy to show </span><span style="font-family: ArialMT; font-size: 12pt;">you a little bit about what I do and how
I can get your property sold. Of course this initial consultation and walk-through is free
of charge and with no obligation for you or me. If it makes sense, we sell the house. If
</span><span style="font-family: ArialMT; font-size: 12pt;">not, we’ve only spent 47 minutes o</span><span style="font-family: ArialMT; font-size: 12pt;">f our time and we can make a different decision.</span><br />

</span></div>
<span style="font-family: 'Arial'; font-size: 12.000000pt; font-weight: 700;"><br /></span>

					<span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">I can’t commit to selling your home yet but our next step is to schedule 47 minutes to
</span><span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">meet and decide if this is a good fit for you and I both. If
</span><span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">we are going to consider it, let’s schedule it now. Just give me a quick call on my cell
and I’ll have my planner with me here to look at the next couple of days. Let’s get
</span><span style="font-family: 'ArialMT'; font-size: 12.000000pt;">together with no obligation and see if this makes sense for you in getting to the closing
table immediately. I can swing by at our scheduled time and we can talk about some
options.
