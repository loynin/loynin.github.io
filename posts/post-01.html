To be honest, I should have hundreds of apps on App Store and Google Play Store if I could follow my goals. The reality is I was not. I have worked hard, but I have accomplished little. Sometime I was procrastinated and was keeping things behind; and sometime I have skipped tasks that I should do. I have tried to find ways to help me to keep focus and pursue my goals but what I have founded seem effect little to my accomplishment.  Who can solve my problem? No one can solve my problem it up to me to find the solution.

For all the reason I was behind, I decided to develop a tool to help me achieve more of my goals. The tool is a mobile app that can run on iOS and Android devices. As I am using this app, I can complete my tasks 75% more than what I used to. To use this app, I have to collect my entire tasks and schedule it in my calendar. After that the magic happen, the app will set the timer for me to the task I have scheduled and count down the time. This helps me to work on the task and compete with the counter and the result is very satisfied.

        This app will be on Apple App Store and Google Play Store on January 1, 2019. Right now I am using the beta version of this app.
